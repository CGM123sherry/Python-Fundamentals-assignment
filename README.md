# Python Functions and Class Project

This project contains a collection of simple Python functions and a class that demonstrate basic programming concepts. The functions cover a variety of tasks, including arithmetic operations, string manipulation, and data structure manipulation. The class example demonstrates object-oriented programming in Python.

## Functions

### add_numbers

This function takes two numbers as input and returns their sum.

### is_even

This function checks if a given number is even and returns True if it is, or False otherwise.

### reverse_string

This function takes a string and returns it reversed.

### count_vowels

This function counts the number of vowels in a string (case insensitive) and returns the count.

### calculate_factorial

This function calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer.

### apply_decorator

This function takes another function as input and applies a decorator to it that prints "Decorator Applied" before executing the function.

### sort_by_age

This function sorts a list of tuples (name, age) by age in ascending order.

### merge_dicts

This function merges two dictionaries, summing the values of common keys.

## Class

### Car

This class represents a car with attributes for make, model, and year. It includes a method to display the car's information.

### how to use.

2. Run the Python scripts to test the functions and class.

# How to run the app in the terminal

1. check the python version

   ### python3 --version

2. Navigate to the Directory Containing the Script. e.g

   ### python3 -u "/Users/macbookair/DEVELOPMENT/code/phase-3/Python-Fundamentals-assignment/lib/functions.py"

3. Run the Python Script
   ### python3 functions.py
